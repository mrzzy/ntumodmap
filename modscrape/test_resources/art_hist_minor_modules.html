            This course will introduce you to the different stages of the visualization of an object for cultural
            heritage processing.The course is composed of the acquisition of the basic theoretical skills as well as the
            function of the equipment to be used; and a second part when theoretical skills are translated into a real
            project by converting theory into practice. The course will give you the tools to develop your skills using
            actual specimens coming from or related to cultural heritage. You will be presented with the broad range of
            techniques to analyse and to document the biography of a specimen. This learning will provide the foundation
            for more advanced investigations into cultural heritage and technology.

            This introductory course covers key movements and events in the evolution of Interaction Design, Product
            Design and Visual Communication. In Interaction Design, you will survey the work and ideas of artists and
            designers who have explored interactive media, as well as the scientists, engineers and mathematicians who
            have developed information technologies. You will study the histories of certain technologies which have
            come to define the medium of personal computer and human-computer interaction. For Product Design, you will
            explore how design trends and movements are formed in the contexts of history, emphasizing human
            relationships between designed objects, visual imageries, art & design movements, science, technology,
            culture and society. In Visual Communication, you will gain a historical awareness of graphic design and its
            relationship to technology and industry practice. You will analyse design and designers from various eras
            through practice and theoretical research projects. This course will equip you with a solid foundation in
            design history and theory, and inform further study in contemporary design practice.

            This lecture course will introduce you to the history and diversity of experimental filmmaking. By comparing
            and contrasting different developments and formats of filmic experiments you will be able to gain a deeper
            insight in the development of different forms and artistic strategies, develop skills for a critical
            approach to film in general and relate specific ideas from the experimental field to the dynamics in
            classical narrative cinema. This means that you will learn to analyse experimental film forms, relate the
            specific knowledge to other contexts, and apply these methods to other filmic concepts and theories. This
            learning will give a historical and theoretical basis for practical film-making projects, as well as future
            research in Film Studies.

            This is an introductory-level course that surveys the historical context of cinema from its inception in the
            silent era, through to the current era, with a special focus on Asian cinema and its forms. You will examine
            how changing political, social, and cultural discourses have affected film production practices for Asian
            filmmakers, and explore identity politics in the age of globalized cultural production. You will then apply
            critical analysis and academic research of specific films and/or national cinema in Asia. This learning will
            form the foundation for further studies in theories and practices of film studies and well as give
            contextual knowledge to your own film projects.

            Does the cinema most resemble the stage, a painting, or a photograph? When is it like poetry? When do we
            treat it like a novel or short story? What is the relationship between cinema, television, video, digital
            arts, and other moving images? What sort of machine is it? Is it more like a picture frame, window on the
            world, mystic writing pad, or a mirror? Does it function like a language, an address, a puzzle, or a
            provocation? How should we examine it in terms of narrative, apparatus, and ideology? In terms of image and
            sound, style, genre, the film artist, and audience reception? What is the relationship between the cinema
            and democracy? These have been the primary questions throughout the history of film theory and will be the
            key concerns of this module. It seeks to introduce students to the history and debates of film theory from
            its beginnings to the contemporary period. Students will be exposed to various ways of addressing films and
            writing about the cinema, including formalist and realist theories, cultural studies approaches to cinema,
            semiotics, auteur theory, genre and star analysis, ideological critiques, and apparatus theory. Screenings
            will include examples from early cinema, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, Potemkin, Man with a Movie Camera,
            Bicycle Thieves, Perfumed Nightmare, Battle of Algiers, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, and Weekend.

            Martin Esslin coined Theatre of the Absurd to group together a substantial number of post-World
            War II dramatic works that questioned realism and challenged the conventional dramatic form.'
            There was no Absurdist movement, and most playwrights whom we consider Absurdists did not
            identify themselves as such. Nevertheless, the designation is useful to begin thinking about their shared
            concern for what it means to be human in a time of social and political upheaval. You will be provoked to
            consider this central question as you learn more about the playwrights' dramatizations of habit, time,
            humour and suffering. The course will train you to close read Absurdist plays, and develop an appreciation
            for theirI destabilising effects on actors and the audience member. By the end of the course, you are
            expected to be able to differentiate between the social, historical,philosophical factors that affect the
            writing and production of absurdist drama. The seminar format will facilitate discussions as you share your
            reading, viewing, and performance/staging experiences with the class.

            Course Content
            The discomfort and frustration evoked by the Theatre of the Absurd force character(s) and the
            audience to confront the question, "What does it mean to be human?" Each week, we will look closely at one
            play, and if a recording of a production is available, we will view snippets in class to give you an idea of
            how each play could be staged. You will also perform scenes from the play in 1, class. The course will
            provoke you to consider what it means to be human as we look closely at absurdist portrayals of habit, time,
            humour and suffering.

            This course will teach you the main characteristics of Gothic literature, as well as the cultural and
            historical contexts of its development. In addition to this, you will gain an in-depth understanding of some
            of the main authors associated with Gothic literature and their key texts. Students interested in literary
            depictions of horror, trauma, fanaticism, paranoia, and guilt should take this course. Students interested
            in the way historical events have shaped literary culture should also take this course. The main value of
            this course is that it concentrates on a major genre within literature in English.

            While the Western world may not have gotten noisier in the early twentieth century, there is evidence that
            people perceived the world as noisier. Emily Thompson explains that in the Victorian period the 'sounds that
            so bothered Carlyle and Goethe were almost identical to those that had been identified by the Buddha
            centuries earlier: organic sounds created by humans and animals at work and at play' (Soundscape 116). It is
            not until the early twentieth century, according to Thompson, that machine-generated noises started to
            impinge upon the everyday lives of people.

            Called the 'Age of Noise,' the turn of twentieth century was filled with the sounds of auditory technologies
            (the microphone, radio, telephone, and phonograph), public transportation (the elevated train and subway),
            World War I, construction, factories, steam locomotives, industrial whistles and bells, machine shops, cash
            registers, washing machines, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, typewriters, printing machines, automobiles,
            trucks, and motorcycles.

            This course explores how modernist writers represented this soundscape. How did they make their narratives
            sound out? How did the changing soundscape influence and shape their representations of sound and listening?

            This course aims to introduce you to a range of challenging films and some general critical tendencies in
            modern Asian cinema. It also seeks to provide you with a vocabulary to describe the formal effects of
            cinema. By the end of the semester, you will be conversant with the films studied, with modern Asian cinema
            as a broad category, and with film as a particular medium with its own history, techniques, and
            possibilities. This will aid you in developing cultural literacy. In addition, as this is a
            writing-intensive course, you will also learn to develop coherent critical written arguments about the films
            studied

            This module seeks to investigate various fictional images of the contemporary world. The contemporary, as it
            appears in the novels on this course, is multi-faceted and represents a truly cosmopolitan series of
            landscapes. These authors are alert to the strains of contemporary music, influenced by film and television,
            conscious of the prevalence of visual imagery in society and are keenly aware of the multi-racial/religious
            natures of their cities and towns. Contemporary British writers are deeply aware of international
            intellectual and artistic developments and the sheer variety of narrative approaches testify to the major
            contribution made by recent writers to the contemporary novel. Thus, it is possible to consider their work
            as representative of contemporary European society, while being conscious of profound threads of connection
            with the idea of the contemporary beyond the borders of Britain.

            History and Archaeology: An Introduction provides a comprehensive overview of the development of two closely
            related fields of study: history and archaeology. In the course, students gain an understanding of the
            objectives, tools and sources of archaeology and history and how the similarities in the two disciplines
            provided the basis for the establishment of historical archaeology as a field of study in the United States
            in the mid-20th century. Since then the field has expanded to other parts of the world including Africa,
            Europe, and Australia. The course introduces students to the history of archaeology defined by its focus on
            material culture, and how its development intersects with history, especially in the study of past cultures,
            societies and technologies of periods when historical documentation was also available. The course begins
            with a diachronic survey of the relations between history and archaeology before narrowing its focus to the
            specific development of historical archaeology in North America and its impact on other parts of the world,
            especially Asia. By examining case studies, images, and readings, the course helps students to acquire
            elementary skills to interpret the information presented in the course. Students will learn to identify and
            discuss key questions, approaches, methods, and sources used in historical archaeology at the end of the
            course.

            This course will build on students` knowledge of the practice of history by introducing
            them to classic works of historiography and the theoretical approaches, which such
            works take. Each week the course will focus on one key work, which will be
            contextualised in terms of its contribution to a wider historical and theoretical debate.
            Approaches covered will include Marxist history, the Annales School, Historical
            Sociology, the history of Nationalism, Micro-history, The Cultural Turn, Gender history,
            Subaltern Studies, Post-Colonial Studies, the history of the Senses, and Oral history.

            This course is foundational for more advanced art historical studies. It seeks to initiate critical
            reflection on 'art' and 'art history' as variable constructs subject to shifting matrixes of interconnected
            factors and forces. Based on a range of visual and textual materials from the pre-modern to the
            contemporary, the East and the West, the 'North' and the 'South', this course investigates the ways of
            seeing, representing, interpreting and thinking about 'art' and 'art history'. The first part of the course
            examines pictorial strategies adopted by image-makers from different periods and parts of the world; the
            second part explores a selection of art historical theories from Europe, East and South Asia. This learning
            will provide a conceptual framework for further, in-depth studies in global Art History.

            This is a foundational survey course covering works of art, artefacts and sites from Southeast Asia. It
            begins with the early cultures of prehistory and ends by investigating persisting traditions found in
            20th-21st century artworks from Southeast Asia. You will study and question the dynamics, themes, and
            complexities that distinguishes the region geographically and artistically. You will develop literacy over a
            range of visual representations by considering their aesthetics, symbolic attributes, and
            cultural/historical significances. You will cultivate and apply these knowledge through independent
            research, critical thinking, oral presentations, written tests and assignments. This will provide a
            foundation for further research and study of art in Southeast Asia.

            This course is designed for students who've already taken foundational Art History and is an introduction to
            the history and development of contemporary artistic practices under the spectrum of New Media. The starting
            point for the course is the situation where fine arts expanded from traditional forms into a new aesthetical
            condition. The course also analyses a number of concepts from Cultural Studies that have found a meaningful
            field in New Media. These studies and discourses will provide a strong knowledge-base for taking further Art
            History modules that focus on art and technology, as well as being applicable for advanced projects in
            design, interaction and animation.

            history of exhibitions, compare museum and independent curatorial approaches, and examine
            contexts/conditions specific to the curating of contemporary art, particularly in Singapore and the
            Southeast Asia region. This course is a foundation for further studies in curating practice and museum

            This course begins with medieval European treasuries and the Renaissance cabinet of curiosities that led to
            the birth of museums in the nineteenth-century. It also examines museums that were established in both the
            West and the East during the period of high colonialism. In addition to exploring issues about collecting
            and displaying, students will also learn about museum education. Mid-term and final projects will be
            centered round studying and reporting on current display patterns and educational practices in Singapore
            museums, and developing educational resources/programs for various age groups from preschoolers to adults.
            Lectures will be enhanced by guest speakers from the world of museums. Field trips to local museums will be
            required.

            This course is an experiential exploration of the ways in which everyday lives in a city like Singapore are
            structured by power, possibility and psychogeography. Students will interrogate the ways public and private
            spaces such as housing estates, public and corporate institutions, school campuses, city streets and
            shopping malls structure the individual imagination. They will then explore how these spaces become infused
            with a myriad of personal stories, memories, fictions, poetics and possibilities.

            This course examines the modern art of Southeast Asia in the 20th Century. Through diverse examples from
            across the region, we will enrich our understandings of 'the modern' by considering how art reveals the
            complexities of modernities. Art in 20th Century Southeast Asia can be characterised as being modern, and
            also as having other qualities - for example, art can be modern and nationalist, or even modern and
            traditional. We will traverse these issues while outlining the historical development of modern art in
            Southeast Asia, familiarising and critically engaging you with key actors, agents and art-historical
            narratives. The intermediate-level course is suited for students with some grounding in art history;
            however, no prior study of Southeast Asia's art is required.

            This survey course will introduce you to developments in Japanese art from the Edo period (17th century) to
            contemporary. You will examine a broad range of visual materials, from Japanese woodblock prints to
            contemporary art, photography, architecture and design, in order to identify and understand major themes and
            critical issues in Japanese art. This course will complement courses in other Asian art histories and
            Japanese literature. It will also provide a basis for further in-depth studies in Japanese art, history and
            culture.

            This course is intended to deepen and widen your pre-existing knowledge of Asian or Buddhist art, and to
            develop critical frameworks for rethinking prevailing canons of Buddhist art. It covers a selection of
            artefacts, sites and works of art from over two millennia from ca. 300BCE to the 21st century. The
            geographical scope mirrors the internationalisation of Buddhism, from South Asia to East, Southeast Asia,
            and the Western world, since the first millennium. We ask: how have Buddhist teachings been interpreted by
            image-makers over space and time, and how have the representations been subsequently experienced, read and
            used, and what makes 'Buddhist art' 'Buddhist' and 'art'? These studies will provide a basis for further
            in-depth studies of Buddhist Art.

            Why write about art? What can writings by art historians and critics, as well as poets, novelists, and
            artists themselves tell us about artworks ? and what can artworks tell us about these writings? What
            experimental and downright weird forms does art writing take, and why? In this course you will examine a
            diverse range of unconventional approaches to writing about art and develop skills to critically evaluate
            these in relation to artworks. Through close readings of selected texts and artworks, you will gain a deeper
            understanding of the relationships between art and writing, guiding you to a theoretically and historically
            rigorous appreciation for the motivations for writing about art, and the nature of Art History as a
            scholarly discipline and de facto literary genre. This course is designed for students who have already
            taken introductory courses in art history and are interested in the discipline's global turn, and its
            relationships to literary studies and other fields in the humanities. In this course, you will study texts
            and artworks from various contexts globally, including in Southeast Asia, other Asias, the Global South and
            the West. This course invites you to participate in key scholarly debates within the discipline of Art
            History that coincide with the growth of interest in global art histories and decolonising approaches to
            art-historical knowledge.
